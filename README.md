# SemFlix player

This is an test project to re-create the NetFlix player.
It should be a fun project to get myself a bit more familiar with Google Closure and the HTML5 video javascript api's.

Please not that this project is currently not finished and work in progress

## Frontend setup

1. Install node and npm
2. Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`

Now open the project from you favourite player and have fun!
